LIVE LINK:https://stalwart-brigadeiros-af1b20.netlify.app/

A modern, interactive dashboard for visualizing, analyzing, and forecasting air quality trends across cities worldwide. This project combines predictive analytics, advanced visualizations, and AI-powered insights to provide actionable health and policy recommendations.

Features
1. Predictive Analytics

Forecasts AQI trends for the next 7‚Äì30 days using Prophet (or ARIMA/LSTM).

Displays predicted values as dashed line overlay on AQI trend charts.

2. Health & Policy Impact Insights

Health Advisory Card: Example ‚Äî ‚ÄúOn average, 4 days this month were Hazardous in Delhi. Suggested: Stay indoors, use air purifiers.‚Äù

Policy Insight Card: Example ‚Äî ‚ÄúReducing PM2.5 in Beijing by 10% could improve AQI by 15 points.‚Äù

3. Advanced Visualizations

Animated Timeline Map / Geo Heatmap: Visualizes air quality changes across cities over time.

Parallel Coordinates Chart: Compare multiple pollutants across cities.

4. Personalized User Experience

Save custom dashboard views (e.g., city comparisons).

Dark/light theme toggle for UI flexibility.

5. AI-Powered Insights

Automatic natural language summaries:
Example ‚Äî ‚ÄúAQI in New Delhi peaked in June due to high PM2.5 levels. London maintained consistently good air quality, except for slight NO‚ÇÇ spikes in November.‚Äù

6. Export & Reporting

One-click PDF or image export of dashboard with charts and key KPIs.

Mobile-friendly responsive design for demo on any device.
